scylla
======

A high-performance RvB engine to emulate the CyberPatriot National Finals competition.

`scylla` can:

- Perform service uptime checks at a defined interval
- Notify teams of and score injects
- Host a patch server
- Display per-service SLA count and uptime percentages
- Display a leaderboard

`scylla` currently has checks for the following:

- [x] establishing a connection over TCP
- [x] establishing a connection over UDP
- [ ] querying DNS records
- [ ] sending HTTP requests and verifying page content
- [ ] retrieving files over FTP/SMB and verifying hashes

`scylla`'s documentation is a work in progress.
